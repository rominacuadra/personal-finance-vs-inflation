# Playbook: Personal Finance vs Inflation (2024–2025)

## 🎯 Objectives
Analyze personal expenses during 2024–2025 and compare them with official inflation data from Argentina (published by INDEC, the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses). The goal is to understand:
- Which categories concentrate most expenses.
- How monthly spending evolves.
- Whether expenses follow overall inflation and category-specific Consumer Price Index (CPI).
- If spending limits are respected.
- What adjustments should be made considering projected inflation.
