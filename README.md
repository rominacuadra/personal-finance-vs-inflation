# personal-finance-vs-inflation

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze personal expenses during 2024–2025 and compare them with official inflation data from Argentina (INDEC – National Institute of Statistics and Censuses). The goal is to understand spending patterns, inflation impact by category, and compliance with predefined limits to provide actionable financial insights.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `data/`: anonymized datasets and external CPI data.
- `analysis/`: Excel dashboards and notebooks.
- `docs/`: narrative documentation and visuals.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for cleaning, projection, and comparison.
- `README.md`: general project overview.

## 🧩 Methodology
1. Data cleaning and normalization.
2. Exploratory analysis (Excel/Python).
3. Comparison with official CPI categories.
4. Evaluation of spending limits.
5. Projection of expenses adjusted for inflation.

## 📊 Expected Deliverables
- Excel dashboard with:
  - Spending by category and subcategory.
  - Monthly evolution.
  - Comparison with inflation.
  - Spending limits compliance.
- Narrative Playbook (`playbook.md`) with conclusions and next steps.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Scale analysis to Power BI for interactive dashboards.
- Publish case study in Notion for narrative presentation.
